The gentle tinkling of cowbells is a sound almost everyone associates with Switzerland.

It conjures up images of peaceful pastures, with majestic snow-capped mountains in the distance.

But what if those bells are right outside your bedroom window day and night, and rather than tinkle gently, clang loudly around the necks of 20 or 30 cows?

That is the dilemma many Swiss communities are facing.

Aarwangen, population 4,700, is a charming village sitting on the banks of the beautiful river Aare, the Bernese Alps in the distance.

It has a medieval castle and an attractive centre with a church and traditional farmhouses.

But the village is also strategically placed to serve Switzerland's highly successful economy.

It is just an hour from Bern, Zurich, and Basel and is a lovely place to live for city workers who want some peace after the day job. Now, a growing number of new houses and apartments extend out from the village's original centre.
